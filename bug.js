This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses AsyncStorage.  The error message may vary, but it often indicates that AsyncStorage is not working correctly within the Expo Go environment. This can be due to issues with the Expo Go app's internal storage, conflicts with other apps, or problems with the AsyncStorage library itself.
