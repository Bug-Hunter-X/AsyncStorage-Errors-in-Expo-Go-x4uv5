The solution depends on the specific error message, but common approaches involve:

1. **Verify AsyncStorage Setup:** Double-check that AsyncStorage is correctly imported and used.

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// ... your AsyncStorage usage ...
```

2. **Clear Expo Go Cache:** Clearing the Expo Go cache may resolve conflicts or data inconsistencies.

3. **Alternative Storage:** For more reliable storage across various environments, consider using a more robust solution like MMKV or SQLite.

4. **Check Permissions:** Ensure your app has necessary storage permissions (although often not a primary reason for Expo Go failures).

5. **Debugging:**  Thoroughly debug AsyncStorage operations to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure (using console.log for example).

If none of these solves the problem, the issue might be rooted within Expo Go itself. You could file an issue with Expo reporting your findings and steps to reproduce. Remember to carefully check your Expo version and any dependencies that could be causing this conflict.
