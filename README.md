# AsyncStorage Errors in Expo Go

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to AsyncStorage functionality within the Expo Go application.  The bug manifests as various errors when attempting to use AsyncStorage, often related to storage access or conflicts.  This is a less common problem, often linked to the specific constraints and environment of Expo Go.

## Bug Description

The issue involves unreliable behavior of AsyncStorage when testing an Expo app using Expo Go. The exact error message can be inconsistent but generally indicates difficulties in accessing or modifying data stored using AsyncStorage.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using Expo Go.
3. Attempt to store and retrieve data using AsyncStorage. Note the error message you receive.

## Solution

The provided solution outlines several strategies to address potential issues, from verifying AsyncStorage setup to alternative storage solutions if necessary.

## Note

This uncommon error is often tied to the unique limitations of the Expo Go environment. Thorough testing in a physical device or simulator is important to determine if the problem is specific to Expo Go or a more general issue in the app's AsyncStorage implementation.
